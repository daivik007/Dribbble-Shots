# Dribbble Shots

This repository serves as a storage space for full-length images of my Figma designs, which I upload to Dribbble. It allows me to keep high-resolution versions of my designs accessible and well-organized.

## Why This Repository?

- **High-Quality Uploads**: Dribbble has limitations on image size, so I store full-length versions here.
- **Version Control**: Track changes and improvements to my designs over time.
- **Easy Access**: A central place to keep my design assets for sharing or future reference.

## How to Use

1. Browse the repository to view my latest Figma designs.
2. Click on any image to see the full resolution.
3. Download images if needed for reference purposes.
